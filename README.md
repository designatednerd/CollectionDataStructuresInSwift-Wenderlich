This repo contains sample project from [my tutorial on RayWenderlich.com comparing collection data structure performance in Swift](https://www.raywenderlich.com/79850/collection-data-structures-swift), for your continued updating pleasure. 

The initial upload covers up to Swift 1.2, but contributions are most welcome to bring it up to date.
